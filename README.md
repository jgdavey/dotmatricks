# DOTMATRICKS

These are my personal dotfiles, based on my personal fork of https://github.com/hashrocket/dotmatrix.

For years, most of my dotfile efforts went into Dotmatrix. There's a lot of knowledge in the history.

These days, I don't need nearly as much stuff at canonical Dotmatrix provides, hence this fork.
